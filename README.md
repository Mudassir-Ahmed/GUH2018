# About
Scroll (literally) through time as you see the website morph chronologically from the 1990s to the present. We wanted a website to bring memories - the good and the bad. Remember that "awesome" Windows XP error sound - we have that. Remember the Internet Explorer crash dialog window - we have that too.
